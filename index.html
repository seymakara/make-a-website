      <h4><b>Me at Bali, 2016 </b></h4>
      <p>Currently, I am a freelancer in San Francisco working on digital marketing and a student learning coding on Udacity. I used to live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul"> Istanbul</a> and teach ESL (English as a Second Language) at a university in Istanbul. I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denizli_Province"> Denizli</a>, which was an ancient Greek City named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierapolis">Hierapolis</a>, in 1988. I studied at <a href="http://www.boun.edu.tr/en_US"> Bogazici University</a>, which definitely has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unibogazici/?hl=tr"> one </a> of the most beautiful campuses in the world [definitely no exaggeration :) ]. During my master, I studied at Syracuse University as an exchange student. After I finished my master's degree, we decided to move to the USA. After living one year in NYC, we moved to San Francisco in the summer of 2016. My next step to discover is going to be Hawai.</p>
